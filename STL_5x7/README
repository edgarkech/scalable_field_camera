We put our format specific STL files in here, so we get a complete set of STL files for building a camera in the specified format

Printed parts

All parts can be printed on any decent 3D printer with sufficient build volume 
- for 5x7" a build volume of at least 235x235x100mm is required

Print settings vary slightly for the different parts - if not explicitly mentioned use
- 0.2mm layers or better
- 4 walls
- 4 bottom/top layers
- when printing with PETG, use at least 15-20% more infill as hinted below, below numbers are for PLA
The tolerances between the parts are quite tight, so you have to sand them. I recommend sanding the dovetail parts with 400 wet sanding paper.

- T6 nut (brass) 
- flange coupler 6mm
- M5 threaded rod, 250mm
- M5x20 screw (1x)
- M5 knurled nuts (3x)
- M5x10 screws with knurled heads (2x)
- M5x12 screws with knurled heads (2x)
- M5 press-in nuts (4x)
- countersunk screws 3x12 (30x)
- countersunk screws 2x10 (6x)
- ground glass 5x7"
- about 700mm of 1.25mm spring steel wire for the ground glass frame
- about 100mm of 0.75mm spring steel wire for the pulling lever mechanism

some hints & sources:
focusing rod:
Find "T6 lead screw" with fitting brass nuts on aliexpress, ebay or your preferred source, similar to this offer: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32507277503.html. 
Take either 2mm or 4mm lead with 200mm length. 
Cut it down to fit into the lid. 
Press the nut into the 10mm hole of the rail lever. 
Secure it with one small screw and file down everything hanging over

bellows frames:
The bellows frames consist of two individual parts (inner and outer frame), but I modeled them as one piece for easier modeling and printing. 
They are just "linked" together via the bottom 0.1mm (for easier printing). Just use a knife to split inner and outer frame and clean up the edges.

front standart:
don't try to print the front standart in its upright position. Lay it down ot its back side and make sure to allow support everywhere.

focusing wheel:
Find "6mm flange coupler" on aliexpress, ebay or your preferred source, similar to this offer: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000208248034.html.
Press it into the Focusing wheel and align the side holes with the threads, so you can screw in the tiny screws.

threaded inserts:
Find "M5 threaded insert" on aliexpress, ebay or your preferred source. I am using M5x6x7 brass insert similar to this: https://www.ebay.com/itm/M5x-5-16mm-Injection-Molding-Nut-Brass-Knurled-Thread-Inserts-Nuts/332250787457. 
Make them hot and press them into the according holes using a M5 threaded rod or a longer screw.

knobs:
All knobs are quite standard M5 screws or nuts. 
3x nut M5, one for swing and two for the lid. 
2x M5x16 for tilt, 2x M5x12 for shift (the flat ones). 
Also one M5x12 for the tripod plate. 
I prefer stainless steel but anything else with similar size will do.
